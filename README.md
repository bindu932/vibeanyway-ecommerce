*VibeAnyway Admin Dashboard** is a full-stack eCommerce administration panel designed to simplify the management of products in an online store. Built with **React.js** on the frontend, **Firebase** for authentication and storage, and **MongoDB** for backend data management, the project provides a powerful, user-friendly interface for handling product details, stock levels, and category-based organization.

This project allows administrators to:
- Add new products with detailed attributes (name, price, description, category, subcategory, sizes, stock levels, image).
- Edit existing product information including dynamic size-wise stock.
- View all products in a styled, responsive grid layout.
- Delete products with confirmation to prevent accidental removals.
- Securely authenticate via email/password and Google using Firebase.
- Navigate easily through protected routes using React Router.

The dashboard supports real-time data interaction with the backend and ensures data persistence through RESTful APIs built on **Node.js + Express** and stored in **MongoDB Atlas**. The design emphasizes responsiveness, modern UI aesthetics, and admin usability.
